## 📝 Notes
- Follow the golden rules: keep files under 500 lines, test after every feature
- Use modular approach: one task per message when working with AI
- Update this document after completing each task
- Start fresh conversations when AI responses degrade
- Prioritize security and isolation from the beginning
